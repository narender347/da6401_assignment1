The Neural_Network.py file consists of forward and backward propogation, the number of layers can be changed from no_of_layers = [784, 128, 64, 10] the first number indicates the number of inputs and the in between numbers indicate the number of hidden layer inputs and the last number indicates the number of outputs, these can be modified and extra hidden layers can be added in between here, Neural_Network.py file  uses the  optimizer.py file , this optimizer.py file consists of classes related to the sgd, momentum, nesterov, rmsprop, adam, nadam and it is also provided.
This Neural_Network.py file is further used for sweeping the hyperparameters and finding out the suitable model to get the accuracy closer to 95%.
sweep_code.py file is for tuning the hyperparameters and finding out the suitable model to get good accuracy.
confusion_matrix.py is for creating the confusion matrix.
A1_Q1 and A1_Q2 are the codes for the question number 1 and question number 2 respectively.
