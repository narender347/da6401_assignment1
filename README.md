The Neural_Network.py file consists of forward and backward propogation wbich imports the optimizer.py file , this optimizer.py file consists of classes related to the sgd, momentum, nesterov, rmsprop, adam, nadam 
This Neural_Network.py file is further used for sweeping the hyperparameters and finding out the suitable model to get the accuracy closer to 95%
sweep_code.py file is for tuning the hyperparameters and finding out the suitable model to get good accuracy.
confusion_matrix.py is for creating the confusion matrix.
